Have you ever commited something unintentionally? If you have, you might reach for `git reset` to roll your history back.

## Roll back and keep your changes

To keep your changes you'll use the `--soft` flag.

The following will roll back one commit from your current state.

```
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

## Roll back and discard your changes

If you never want to see that code again you'll use the `--hard` flag. There is no undo for this, so be careful! I've definitely learned this lesson the _hard_ way.

The following will roll back one commit from your current state and _discard all changes_.

```
$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## To reset your HEAD to a specific commit

If you are looking to roll back to a specific commit you will pass the id of that commit. The commit you pass will become the new `HEAD` of your tree.

```
$ git reset --soft 32eccb1
```

## Learn more

There is a lot more that `git reset` can do for you. You can find the docs [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset) if you want to know more.

If you are just looking to edit the commit itself and not roll your history back you might be looking for `git commit --amend`. The docs for this can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---amend).
