If you find that `git log` is a little too wordy for your liking, there are a number of flags that you can use to trim it down a bit.

Running `git log` will give you a response that looks something like this.

```txt
$ git log

    Cleans up main.js and updates package name
```

Try `git log --oneline` to trim that right down. This is really handy if you want to look back at a lot of history at once.

```
$ git log --oneline

32eccb1 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Updates the darkness toggle so that it is applied to <html>
7d1c6ca Cleans up main.js and updates package name
```

If you only want to see the commit id and message try `git log --oneline --no-decorate`.

```
$ git log --oneline --no-decorate

32eccb1 Updates the darkness toggle so that it is applied to <html>
7d1c6ca Cleans up main.js and updates package name
```

There are _so many_ other useful flags you can use with `git log`. To learn more [check out the official git docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log).
