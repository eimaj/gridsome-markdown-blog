I've talked about doing this many times over the years. I've even started a couple times. So here I am again.

In the past I've tried writing for other people. I've tried writing in depth articles. I think I even kept a travel journal once. This time I'm going to approach it a little differently: _I'm going to write for me._

I'm going to write about lessons things I've learned. Gotchas I've encountered. Things I don't want to forget. Maybe summarize courses I've taken or articles I've read. There will probably some articles about keyboards too.

And I'm going to keep them short.

Hopefully this time it sticks. ðŸŽ‰
